Works-Like Prototype
====================

Interface functionality:
------------------------
- Volume up (button)
- Volume down (button)
- Active mode toggle (button)
- Audio input (microphone?)
- Audio output (speaker)
- Proximity sensitivity (dial/pot?)

- high frequency sound triangulation? -- different frequency for each thing? -- processing chip fft for frequency
	- directional microphone on reciever 
	- speaker on transmitter

Demonstrating for Phase 3 Pinup:
--------------------------------
- Vibration intensity changing on distance
	- Faked distance (eg: passing on integer distance)
	- Faked distance (eg: calculating difference from longitude and latitude?)
- Indication of direction?
	- Print statement out?
- Change in proximity sensitivity
	- Print statement of what detection range is, as potentiometer is changed
	- Changing vibration/light intensity as a result, given the same input
+ Ability to toggle between modes
	+ Print statement of 'active mode' when button is pressed
	- LED light up when button is pressed? 

- Audio out is presumably quite ambitious? 

Items needed for demo:
----------------------
+ vibration motor x 1
- potentiometer x 1
-	 button x 3
- speaker (use computer)
